# Real Time Chat App

## Introduction

The Chat App Frontend is built using modern web technologies to create a responsive and interactive user interface for a chat application. It communicates with a [backend server](https://github.com/mritunjayupadhyay/chat-app-backend) to facilitate real-time messaging and user interactions. You can check live version [here](https://chat.mjcodes.dev).

## Features

- **Photo Sharing**: Users can send and receive pictures in real-time.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the chat.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
